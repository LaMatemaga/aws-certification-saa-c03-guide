Hello, and welcome to this course on compute in AWS, where we’re here to help you on your journey to prepare for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification. Before we get started, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Danny Jessee, and I am one of the trainers here at Cloud Academy, specializing in AWS – Amazon Web Services – and AWS certifications.

In this course, the AWS team will be presenting a series of lectures that introduce the various compute services currently available in AWS that may be covered on the exam. Feel free to contact me with any questions using the details shown on the screen, or you can always get in touch with us here at Cloud Academy by sending an email to support@cloudacademy.com, where one of our Cloud experts will reply to your question.

This course has been specifically curated to help you pass the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) exam** and is ideal for anyone who is looking to learn more about the various compute services in AWS in preparation for the exam.

The objective of this course is to provide an introduction to [[compute]] services in AWS for solution architects, including:
- [[Amazon EC2]]
- [[Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)]]
- [[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)]]
- [[Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)]]
- [[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]]
- [[AWS Lambda]]
- [[AWS Batch]]

We’ll also introduce the concept of [[Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)]], along with the different types of load balancers you can provision within the AWS Cloud. We’ll discuss [[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling]] and see how it works together with Elastic Load Balancing to help you build robust, highly available web applications. And finally we’ll discuss options for on-premises hybrid cloud architectures using [[AWS Outposts]].

Together with the other courses in this learning path, we’ll cover all of the key tools, technologies, and concepts from the [[AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) Exam Guide]] and ensure that you are fully prepared to sit this exam.

The **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification** has been designed for anyone who has experience designing cloud solutions that use AWS services to meet current and future business requirements, as well as architectures that are secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-optimized in accordance with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. All of the AWS Cloud concepts introduced in this course will be explained and reinforced from the ground up.

Here at Cloud Academy, we strive to keep our content current to provide the best training available.
