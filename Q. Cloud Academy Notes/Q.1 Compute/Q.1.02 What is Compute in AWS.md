>Previous: [[Q.1.01 Compute Introduction]]

Hello, and welcome to this short lecture where we’ll answer the question, “what is compute in AWS?” Before we begin to explore compute services, resources, and features, we must first understand what is meant by the term compute.

See [[Compute]] for more information about this concept.

So compute is closely related to common server components that you’re probably already familiar with, such as CPUs and RAM. With that in mind, a physical server within a data center would be considered a compute resource, as it probably has multiple CPUs and many gigabytes of RAM to process instructions given by the operating system and applications. 

Within AWS, there are a number of different services and features that offer compute power to provide different functions. Some services may utilize hundreds of [[Amazon EC2]] instances, or virtual servers, which may be used continuously for months or even years, processing billions of instructions. On the opposite end of this scale, you may only need to utilize a few milliseconds of compute resources to execute a couple lines of Python code within a serverless [[AWS Lambda]] function in response to an event before relinquishing that compute power. Compute resources can be consumed in different quantities, for different lengths of time across a wide range of categories, offering a variety of performance and benefit options. So the compute resources you will use within AWS will ultimately depend on your overall business requirements. 

That brings me to the end of this lecture. Thank you so much for your time, and best of luck with your continued learning.
